# bunchofbricks

This little project is my experimentation with `three.js` (using
`react-three-fiber`) and maintaining a fulsome React application

There are many voxel painter examples for `three.js`, but I was not able to find
one that uses React hooks. This began as such, and then evolved slightly more.

No particular direction with this project except to hack on it and learn new
things!
