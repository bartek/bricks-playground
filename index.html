    <h1>Pokemon - Get building!</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! This is a growing database of instructions for how to build various Pokemon out of LEGO. As you can see,
        there's a lot of work to do yet.
        Our goal is to tackle the original 150 first and specifically, looking to get them done in the "micro" style,
        which was inspired by Pokemon Quest
    </p>
    <p>Want to contribute? We're working on making it easier. For now, please send us a completed photo of your pokemon
        with as many useful angles as you can. We'll deconstruct it and map out the build process. Please also include
        credit information so you can properly get attribution!</p>
