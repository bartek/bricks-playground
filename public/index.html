      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

  <h1>Pokemon - Get building!</h1>
  <!--
  <p>
    Hello! This is a growing database of instructions for how to build various Pokemon out of LEGO. As you can see,
    there's a lot of work to do yet.
    Our goal is to tackle the original 150 first and specifically, looking to get them done in the "micro" style,
    which was inspired by Pokemon Quest
  </p>
  <p>Want to contribute? We're working on making it easier. For now, please send us a completed photo of your pokemon
    with as many useful angles as you can. We'll deconstruct it and map out the build process. Please also include
    credit information so you can properly get attribution!</p>
